# Histogram-EQ-Small-Practice-Images
Tiny (5x5) .bmp images for my classmates to use while trying to implement a histogram EQ.

Histogram equalization increases the contrast in an image. It can be especially dramatic. Here's `moon.bmp` from `images`, versus `moon.bmp` from `results`:

![](./images/moon.bmp)
![](./results/moon.bmp)

And two more:

![](./results/paper.bmp)

![](./images/paper2.jpg)
![](./results/paper2.bmp)

You can find the 5x5 bitmaps in `test_images`, and their processed versions under the same name in `test_results`. `test_image_2_xxx.bmp` means that there are only 2 grayscale values in that image, so your histogram should output a purely black-and-white image.
